Key Questions & Clarifications Needed:

  1. User Authentication & Data Privacy

  - Should we implement user accounts/login, or keep it completely stateless? <-- keep it stateless at this moment
  - For healthcare professionals vs. patients - do we need different interfaces or access levels? <- same interface and access level please
  - Given the "DO NOT LOG ANY DATA" requirement, should we implement session-based temporary storage that clears after each session? <- implement a session-based temporary storage please

  2. Technical Implementation Clarifications

  - Model Loading: Do you want to load all 36+ models from foundation_models/ at startup, or implement lazy loading? Yes, load them all
  - UPCR to UACR Conversion: I see references to this conversion in the codebase - should I locate the specific conversion formula from the existing code? <- yes, you should be able to find and get the formula from the recent codebase
  - Sequence Length: The models expect 10 time points - what should we do if a user has fewer than 10 data points? Forward-fill, interpolation, or minimum data requirements? <- if the input is still less than 10 time points after the imputer and preprocessor I provided in /mnt/dump/yard/projects/tarot2/foundation_models/ckd_preprocessor.pkl, embed the input array wit 0

  3. User Experience Design

  - Progressive Form: Should we use a multi-step form wizard, or single-page form? <- multistep form wizard
  - Unit Selection: For each lab value, should users see dropdown with all common units (e.g., creatinine: mg/dL, μmol/L) or auto-detect from value ranges? <- let user select dropdown with common units please
  - Date Input: How flexible should date inputs be? (e.g., "approximately 2 years ago" vs. exact dates) <- let the user select from calender

  4. Results Presentation

  - Risk Visualization: The line plot for 1-5 year risk - should we include confidence intervals or just point estimates? <- with 95% CI please
  - SHAP Explanation: How technical should the SHAP explanations be for patient users vs. healthcare professionals? <- A more technical explaination targeting to healthcare professional, but still need add disclaimer to explain that SHAP is not correlation, it is association.
  - Benchmarking: Should we show how the patient's risk compares to population averages or clinical thresholds? <- mark the KDIGO CKD guideline benchmark on the risk plot:
   A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3%–5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral
   A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care
   A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of >40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation

  5. API Specifications

  - Input Format: JSON schema for the API - should it accept the raw user inputs or preprocessed features? raw user inputs
  - Output Format: Should API responses include raw CIF arrays, processed percentages, or both? raw CIF arrays and SHAP values
  - Rate Limiting: Any authentication or rate limiting requirements for API access? No

  6. Deployment & Distribution

  - Packaging: Docker containers, or multiple deployment options? docker please
  - Model Dependencies: The models are quite large (in foundation_models/) - should we provide model download scripts or bundle everything? model download script please
  - Documentation: What level of technical documentation is needed for healthcare institutions? a professional technical notes so the IT department can use it to deploy in their own server

  7. Clinical Validation Display

  - Should we display model performance metrics (c-index, etc.) to build trust with healthcare professionals? a static page using results data from /mnt/dump/yard/projects/tarot2/results/ensemble_kfre_comparison/results_table.md should be fine
  - Any disclaimers or warnings required for clinical use? Add a static page of disclaimer please 

  Proposed Technical Stack

  - Backend: FastAPI (Python) for model inference and API
  - Frontend: React with scientific plotting (Plotly/D3)
  - Deployment: Docker containers
  - Testing: Pytest for backend, Jest for frontend

  Critical Success Metrics

  - Inference time < 200ms (as per model requirements)
  - Support for all required unit conversions
  - Zero data logging/persistence
  - Clinical-grade UI/UX for both user typess
