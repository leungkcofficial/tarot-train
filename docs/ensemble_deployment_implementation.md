# Ensemble Deployment Pipeline Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the ensemble deployment pipeline for CKD risk prediction models.

## Created Components

### 1. Steps

#### `steps/load_model_configurations.py`
- Loads model configurations from CSV and JSON files
- Handles 36 different model configurations
- Extracts model metadata and optimization details
- Returns a list of model configuration dictionaries

#### `steps/train_and_deploy_single_model.py`
- Trains and deploys a single model based on its configuration
- Creates model-specific hyperparameter configurations
- Calls the existing `deploy_model` step
- Returns deployment details and prediction file paths

#### `steps/stack_predictions.py`
- Stacks predictions from multiple models
- Groups DeepSurv models by characteristics (Algorithm, Structure, Balancing, Optimization)
- Stacks Event 1 and Event 2 predictions for DeepSurv models
- Handles DeepHit predictions which are already in the correct format
- Returns dictionaries of stacked predictions

#### `steps/ensemble_predictions.py`
- Creates ensemble predictions using simple averaging
- Combines predictions from all models
- Saves ensemble predictions to HDF5 files
- Generates metadata for tracking
- Extensible to support other ensemble methods (weighted averaging, voting)

#### `steps/ensemble_evaluator.py`
- Evaluates ensemble prediction performance
- Calculates metrics for both temporal and spatial test sets
- Computes C-index and Integrated Brier Score for each event type
- Saves evaluation results to JSON files
- Provides summary statistics

### 2. Utility Functions

#### `src/model_config_utils.py`
- `create_model_specific_config()`: Creates hyperparameter configurations for each model
- `save_model_specific_config()`: Saves configurations to YAML files
- `get_model_identifier()`: Generates unique identifiers for models

### 3. Pipeline Integration

#### `pipelines/ensemble_deploy_pipeline.py`
- Integrated all steps into a cohesive pipeline
- Processes models sequentially to save memory
- Handles errors gracefully (continues if individual models fail)
- Returns comprehensive results including all intermediate outputs

## Pipeline Flow

1. **Load Configurations**: Read model_config.csv and corresponding JSON files
2. **Train Models**: Process each model individually using its specific configuration
3. **Stack Predictions**: Group DeepSurv predictions by event type
4. **Ensemble**: Average predictions across all models
5. **Evaluate**: Calculate performance metrics on test sets

## Key Features

- **Memory Efficient**: Processes models one at a time
- **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if individual models fail
- **Flexible**: Easy to extend with new ensemble methods
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluates on both temporal and spatial test sets
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Creates output directories as needed

## Output Structure

```
results/final_deploy/
├── individual_predictions/     # Individual model predictions
├── ensemble_predictions/       # Ensemble predictions
│   ├── ensemble_temporal_predictions_[timestamp].h5
│   ├── ensemble_spatial_predictions_[timestamp].h5
│   └── ensemble_metadata_[timestamp].json
└── ensemble_eval/             # Evaluation results
    └── ensemble_evaluation_[timestamp].json
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the pipeline with all 36 models
2. Monitor memory usage during execution
3. Implement additional ensemble methods if needed
4. Add visualization of results
5. Optimize performance for large-scale deployment

## Usage

To run the ensemble pipeline:

```python
from pipelines.ensemble_deploy_pipeline import ensemble_pipeline

# Run the pipeline
results = ensemble_pipeline()
```

The pipeline will automatically:
- Load all model configurations
- Train each model with its specific settings
- Generate predictions for all test sets
- Create ensemble predictions
- Evaluate performance
- Save all results
