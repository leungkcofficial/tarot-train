# Final Deploy V2 Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NaN Balancing Method Handling
**Problem**: Models with NaN balancing methods caused "argument of type 'float' is not iterable" errors.

**Fix**: Added explicit check for NaN values using `pd.isna()` and convert to 'None' string:
```python
# Handle NaN balancing method
if pd.isna(balancing_method):
    balancing_method = 'None'
```

### 2. LSTM Architecture Mismatch
**Problem**: LSTM models had different hidden dimensions in saved weights than the default architecture, causing size mismatch errors.

**Fix**: Created `load_model_with_flexible_architecture()` function that:
- Inspects the saved state dict to detect actual LSTM architecture
- Extracts hidden dimensions, number of layers, and bidirectional flag
- Creates network matching the saved architecture
- Example: Model 17 had `[83, 50]` hidden dims instead of default `[128, 64]`

### 3. GPU/CPU Tensor Conversion
**Problem**: DeepHit models failed with "can't convert cuda:0 device type tensor to numpy" errors.

**Fix**: Added explicit CPU conversion for DeepHit predictions:
```python
# Move to CPU if on GPU
if isinstance(predictions, torch.Tensor):
    predictions = predictions.cpu().numpy()
```

### 4. Missing Model Weights
**Problem**: Some model weight files were not found at expected paths.

**Fix**: Added fallback path checking:
```python
if not os.path.exists(model_path):
    # Try alternative path in results/model_details
    alt_path = os.path.join('results/model_details', os.path.basename(model_path))
    if os.path.exists(alt_path):
        model_path = alt_path
```

## Results from Test Run

From the pipeline execution, we successfully processed 8 models:
- Models 1-12: DeepSurv ANN models (4 groups successfully stacked)
- Models 13-24: DeepSurv LSTM models (all failed due to architecture mismatch)
- Models 25-36: DeepHit models (all failed due to NaN balancing or GPU issues)

The pipeline created ensemble predictions from the 4 successful DeepSurv ANN groups.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the fixed pipeline** to process all 36 models successfully
2. **Generate individual predictions** for all models
3. **Run ensemble combination evaluation** to find the best model combination
4. **Deploy the best ensemble** for production use

## Usage

```bash
# Run the fixed pipeline
cd /mnt/dump/yard/projects/tarot2
PYTHONPATH=/mnt/dump/yard/projects/tarot2:$PYTHONPATH python pipelines/final_deploy_v2_fixed.py

# After successful completion, run ensemble evaluation
python pipelines/ensemble_combination_evaluation.py
