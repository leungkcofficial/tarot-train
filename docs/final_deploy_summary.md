# Multi-Model Deployment Pipeline Summary

## Project Overview
This pipeline deploys 36 pre-trained survival analysis models (24 DeepSurv + 12 DeepHit) to generate ensemble predictions for CKD risk assessment.

## Key Requirements

### Model Types
1. **DeepSurv Models (24)**
   - Binary endpoint models (Event 1: RRT/eGFR<15 or Event 2: Mortality)
   - Algorithms: ANN, LSTM
   - Balancing: None, NearMiss v1, NearMiss v3, KNN
   - Optimization: Concordance Index, Log-likelihood

2. **DeepHit Models (12)**
   - Competing risks models (Both endpoints simultaneously)
   - Algorithms: ANN, LSTM
   - Balancing: None, NearMiss v3, KNN
   - Optimization: Concordance Index, Log-likelihood

### Prediction Processing Pipeline

#### DeepSurv Processing
1. Generate survival probabilities: (1825, n_samples)
2. Convert to CIF: CIF = 1 - survival_probability
3. Extract at time points [365, 730, 1095, 1460, 1825]: (5, n_samples)
4. Stack Event 1 & 2 by matching characteristics: (2, 5, n_samples)

#### DeepHit Processing
1. Generate CIF predictions: (2, 5, n_samples)
2. Already in correct format

#### Ensemble
1. Combine all 24 model groups: (24, 2, 5, n_samples)
2. Apply simple averaging: (2, 5, n_samples)

## Technical Details

### Prediction Shapes
- **DeepSurv Raw**: (1825, n_samples) - survival probabilities
- **DeepSurv Processed**: (5, n_samples) - CIF at 5 time points
- **DeepHit**: (2, 5, n_samples) - CIF for 2 endpoints at 5 time points
- **Stacked DeepSurv**: (2, 5, n_samples) - Event 1 & 2 combined
- **Final Ensemble**: (2, 5, n_samples) - averaged across all models

### Model Grouping (DeepSurv)
Models are grouped by:
1. Algorithm (ANN/LSTM)
2. Structure (network architecture)
3. Balancing Method
4. Optimization Target

Each group contains 2 models (Event 1 and Event 2), resulting in 12 groups.

## Next Steps

1. **Review the plan** with the user
2. **Switch to Code mode** to implement the pipeline
3. **Test with a subset** of models first
4. **Validate outputs** before full deployment
5. **Document any issues** or deviations from the plan

## Notes for Implementation

- Use batch processing to manage memory
- Clear GPU memory between models
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Log all operations for debugging
- Save intermediate results for recovery
- Validate shapes at each processing step
